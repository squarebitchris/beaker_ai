# R1-E02-T004: Vapi Client - Create Assistant API Integration

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Points:** 4  
**Epic:** E-002 Trial Flow  
**Completed:** October 26, 2025

## Summary

Implemented comprehensive Vapi.ai API client integration with complete assistant creation payload structure, including model configuration, voice selection, duration caps for trial abuse prevention, webhook URL registration, and metadata tracking.

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`app/services/vapi_client.rb`**
   - Refactored `create_assistant` method to use structured configuration
   - Added `build_assistant_payload` helper method for complex Vapi API payloads
   - Included model configuration (provider, model name, temperature, system prompt)
   - Added voice configuration (provider, voice ID)
   - Implemented duration caps (`maxDurationSeconds`, `silenceTimeoutSeconds`)
   - Registered webhook URL (`serverUrl`) for call event notifications
   - Added metadata support for tracking trial information

2. **`app/jobs/create_trial_assistant_job.rb`**
   - Updated `build_assistant_config` to construct full Vapi-compatible configuration
   - Integrated knowledge base context via `KbGenerator`
   - Passed duration caps (120s max, 30s silence timeout) for trial abuse prevention
   - Added trial metadata (trial_id, industry, business_name) to assistant

3. **`spec/services/vapi_client_spec.rb`**
   - Added comprehensive tests for new payload structure
   - Verified all required Vapi API fields are present in request
   - Tested duration caps are correctly applied
   - Verified webhook `serverUrl` is included
   - Added ENV mocking for `APP_URL` to prevent test failures

4. **`spec/jobs/create_trial_assistant_job_spec.rb`**
   - Updated expectations to match new configuration structure
   - Verified KB context integration
   - Ensured metadata is passed correctly to Vapi client

## Technical Decisions

### Vapi API Payload Structure
```ruby
{
  name: "Business Name Assistant",
  model: {
    provider: "openai",
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    temperature: 0.7,
    systemPrompt: "System prompt with KB context"
  },
  voice: {
    provider: "11labs",
    voiceId: "rachel"
  },
  firstMessage: "Hi, I'm calling from...",
  functions: [...],  # Tool definitions
  maxDurationSeconds: 120,        # Trial cap
  silenceTimeoutSeconds: 30,      # Trial cap
  serverUrl: "https://app.com/webhooks/vapi",
  metadata: {
    trial_id: "uuid",
    industry: "hvac",
    business_name: "Acme HVAC"
  }
}
```

### Duration Caps for Abuse Prevention
- **Max Duration:** 120 seconds (2 minutes) per trial call
- **Silence Timeout:** 30 seconds to detect abandoned calls
- These caps prevent trial abuse while allowing meaningful conversations

### Webhook Registration
- `serverUrl` automatically set to `#{APP_URL}/webhooks/vapi`
- Enables real-time call event notifications (call.started, call.ended, etc.)
- Critical for Phase 2 mini-report implementation

## Test Coverage

- 374 total examples passing
- 90.63% code coverage
- Specific coverage for:
  - Assistant creation with full payload
  - Duration caps enforcement
  - Webhook URL registration
  - Metadata inclusion
  - Error handling and circuit breaker behavior

## Acceptance Criteria Met

- ✅ Vapi client creates assistants with complete configuration
- ✅ Model and voice settings correctly structured
- ✅ Duration caps applied for trial abuse prevention
- ✅ Webhook URL registered for call events
- ✅ Metadata tracked for trial association
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Circuit breaker protection maintained
- ✅ Integration with CreateTrialAssistantJob

## Dependencies

- Requires: T005 (KB generation) for complete system prompt
- Enables: T007 (Trial status polling), Phase 2 webhook processing
- Integrates with: T006 (CreateTrialAssistantJob)

## Notes

- Using `gpt-4o-mini` model for cost optimization
- ElevenLabs "rachel" voice selected as default
- Duration caps are trial-specific; paid assistants will not have these limits
- `APP_URL` environment variable required for webhook URL generation

## Performance

- Assistant creation typically completes in 1-3 seconds
- Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures
- Exponential backoff retry logic handles transient API errors
