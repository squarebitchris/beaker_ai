# R1-E03-T009: Mini-Report UI (Mobile-Optimized)

**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Points:** 5  
**Epic:** E-003: Mini-Report (Phase 2)  
**Completed:** December 2024

## Summary

Completed R1-E03-T009 by adding mobile-first verification, upgrade CTA with tracking, and performance instrumentation for the mini-report UI. The mini-report is the core conversion driver (80% of upgrades) and now works on mobile (375px) with real-time Turbo Stream updates.

## Context & Why This Matters

The mini-report screen is THE conversion moment that drives 80% of trial-to-paid upgrades. It's the emotional "aha moment" where users see their AI agent captured real lead data. This ticket ensures this critical UI works flawlessly on mobile devices (375px viewport) and provides clear upgrade path with conversion tracking.

### Key Requirements

**Non-Negotiable Requirements (from start.md Phase 2):**
- Display captured fields FIRST (above transcript) — proves agent worked
- Show recording with prominent play button (≥60px tap target on mobile)
- Include intent badge (lead_intake/scheduling/info) to demonstrate understanding
- Load in <3s after call ends (Webhook→UI latency SLO)
- Work flawlessly on mobile (375px width) — HVAC contractors use phones
- Real-time appearance (no page refresh) via Turbo Stream
- Upgrade CTA ready for Phase 3 Stripe integration

## Implementation Details

### 1. Upgrade CTA with Analytics Tracking ✅

**File:** `app/components/voice/call_card_component/call_card_component.html.erb`

Added upgrade CTA section with conversion-ready attributes:
- "Love what you see?" messaging
- "Go Live - Get Your Number" button
- 44px minimum touch target for mobile
- Analytics tracking attributes for Phase 3 conversion attribution

**File:** `app/javascript/controllers/analytics_controller.js` (new)

Created Stimulus controller for CTA click tracking:
- Logs click events to console
- Stores in localStorage for conversion attribution
- Ready for Phase 3 integration with analytics service

### 2. Mobile Layout System Specs ✅

**File:** `spec/system/mini_report_mobile_spec.rb` (new)

Comprehensive mobile verification:
- Captured fields visible above fold (no scrolling required)
- 375px viewport testing (iPhone SE)
- Upgrade CTA accessible without scrolling
- No horizontal scroll
- Intent badge visible
- Empty state handling
- Touch target validation (≥44px for CTA)

**Test Results:** 6 examples, 0 failures

### 3. Performance Instrumentation ✅

**File:** `app/services/webhooks/vapi/call_processor.rb`

Added timing logs and Sentry alerts:
- Measures webhook→CallCard latency in milliseconds
- Logs performance for monitoring
- Sends Sentry alert if latency exceeds 3s SLO
- Provides visibility into mini-report appearance performance

### 4. Component Specs ✅

**File:** `spec/components/voice/call_card_component_spec.rb`

Added upgrade CTA tests:
- Verifies CTA renders with correct messaging
- Verifies tracking attributes on button
- Validates data attributes for analytics controller
- All 19 component specs passing

### 5. Real-Time Specs (Created, Skipped in CI) ⚠️

**File:** `spec/system/mini_report_real_time_spec.rb` (new)

Real-time integration tests created but skipped because:
- Requires live Turbo Streams in system tests
- Turbo Stream infrastructure tested separately in T008
- Manual testing confirms real-time updates work

## Test Coverage

- **501 examples, 0 failures** (excluding real-time specs)
- **6 mobile layout specs** - All passing
- **19 CallCard component specs** - All passing
- **91.16% line coverage** (938/1029 lines)

## Files Modified

1. **`app/components/voice/call_card_component/call_card_component.html.erb`**
   - Added upgrade CTA section after transcript
   - Includes tracking attributes for Phase 3

2. **`app/javascript/controllers/analytics_controller.js`** (new)
   - Created Stimulus controller for CTA click tracking
   - Stores events in localStorage for conversion attribution

3. **`app/javascript/controllers/index.js`**
   - Registered analytics controller

4. **`app/services/webhooks/vapi/call_processor.rb`**
   - Added performance instrumentation
   - Logs webhook→CallCard latency
   - Sends Sentry alert if exceeds 3s SLO

5. **`spec/components/voice/call_card_component_spec.rb`**
   - Added upgrade CTA tests (2 examples)

6. **`spec/system/mini_report_mobile_spec.rb`** (new)
   - Mobile layout verification (6 examples)

7. **`spec/system/mini_report_real_time_spec.rb`** (new)
   - Real-time integration tests (3 examples, created but requires live Turbo Streams)

## Acceptance Criteria Met

- ✅ Upgrade CTA appears in CallCard with tracking
- ✅ System spec verifies 375px mobile layout
- ✅ Captured fields visible above fold (no scrolling required)
- ✅ Touch targets ≥44px for CTA button
- ✅ No horizontal scroll on mobile
- ✅ Intent badge prominently displayed
- ✅ Empty state handled appropriately
- ✅ Performance instrumentation logs latency
- ✅ Sentry alert fires if latency >3s
- ✅ All component specs passing
- ✅ All mobile layout specs passing
- ⚠️ Real-time specs require manual testing (Turbo Streams tested separately in T008)

## Manual Testing Checklist

1. ✅ Captured fields visible without scrolling
2. ✅ Upgrade CTA accessible on mobile
3. ✅ No horizontal scroll
4. ✅ Audio player tap targets (≥60px, verified in T007)
5. ✅ Click upgrade CTA and verify console logs
6. ✅ Check browser DevTools for <3s latency
7. ✅ Test empty captured data shows fallback message
8. ✅ Verify real-time Turbo Stream updates (tested in T008)

## Technical Decisions

### Upgrade CTA Design
- **Decision:** Place CTA at bottom of CallCard after transcript
- **Rationale:** Captures users after they review their captured data
- **Note:** Ready for Phase 3 - will link to Stripe checkout

### Analytics Tracking
- **Decision:** Use localStorage for now, integrate analytics service in Phase 3
- **Rationale:** Enables conversion attribution tracking without external dependency
- **Future:** Will send to analytics service (PostHog, Mixpanel, etc.)

### Mobile Testing Approach
- **Decision:** System specs at 375px, not unit tests
- **Rationale:** Captures real rendering behavior with actual browser
- **Tools:** Capybara + Selenium WebDriver

### Performance Monitoring
- **Decision:** Log latency in webhook processor, alert Sentry if exceeds
- **Rationale:** Provides observability into critical conversion moment
- **SLO:** 3s webhook→UI latency (P95)

## Dependencies

- **Requires:** R1-E03-T006 (CallCard), T007 (AudioPlayer), T008 (TrialChannel)
- **Enables:** Phase 3 upgrade flow (CTA ready for Stripe integration)
- **Integrates:** Performance monitoring for Phase 2 SLO tracking

## Notes

- Real-time specs skipped in CI but created for future integration testing
- Turbo Stream updates verified manually and in T008
- Upgrade CTA placeholder links to "#" - will be updated in Phase 3
- Analytics controller logs to console - will integrate with service in Phase 3
