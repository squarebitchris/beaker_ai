# R2-E04-T004: Stripe Webhook Handler - COMPLETED

**Ticket:** R2-E04-T004 - Stripe webhook handler (checkout.session.completed)  
**Points:** 4  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Completed:** January 26, 2025

## Overview

Implemented Stripe webhook processing infrastructure to handle `checkout.session.completed` events and route subscription lifecycle events for Phase 3 monetization flow.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Stripe Checkout Session Processor

**File:** `app/services/webhooks/stripe/checkout_session_processor.rb`

Created processor to handle `checkout.session.completed` webhooks:

- Extracts session data from webhook payload
- Validates required metadata (`user_id`, `trial_id`, `plan`, `business_name`)
- Prepares parameters for `ConvertTrialToBusinessJob` (stubbed for R2-E04-T005)
- Returns early if metadata is missing (graceful error handling)
- Logs processing details for debugging

**Key Features:**
- Idempotency: Framework already handles via `WebhookEvent` unique constraint
- Error handling: Missing metadata returns early without crashing
- Logging: Detailed metadata logging for troubleshooting
- Pattern consistency: Follows existing `Webhooks::Vapi::CallProcessor` pattern

### 2. Stripe Subscription Processor Stub

**File:** `app/services/webhooks/stripe/subscription_processor.rb`

Created stub processor for future Phase 4+ subscription lifecycle events:

- Handles `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`
- Logs events for monitoring
- Ready for future implementation when subscription management is added

### 3. Webhook Routing Updates

**File:** `app/jobs/webhook_processor_job.rb` (lines 15-23)

Updated routing logic to instantiate Stripe processors:

```ruby
when "stripe"
  if event.event_type.match?(/checkout\.session\.completed/)
    Webhooks::Stripe::CheckoutSessionProcessor.new(event)
  elsif event.event_type.match?(/customer\.subscription\./)
    Webhooks::Stripe::SubscriptionProcessor.new(event)
  else
    Rails.logger.warn("[Webhook] No processor for #{event.provider}:#{event.event_type}")
    nil
  end
```

### 4. Comprehensive Test Coverage

**Files Created:**
- `spec/services/webhooks/stripe/checkout_session_processor_spec.rb` (9 test cases)
- `spec/services/webhooks/stripe/subscription_processor_spec.rb` (3 test cases)

**Tests Added to `webhook_processor_job_spec.rb`:**
- Stripe checkout session processing integration (4 new test contexts)
- Subscription event routing
- Unknown event handling
- Missing metadata handling

**Total New Tests:** 16 examples covering:
- ✅ Valid checkout.session.completed processing
- ✅ Missing metadata handling
- ✅ Missing session data handling
- ✅ Malformed payload handling
- ✅ Subscription event routing
- ✅ Unknown Stripe events
- ✅ Idempotency (via webhook framework)

## Test Results

```bash
559 examples, 3 failures (unrelated - mini-report system tests)
28 examples for Stripe webhook implementation, 0 failures
```

The 3 failures are pre-existing system tests for mini-report real-time updates, not related to this implementation.

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Processors are Stubbed

The `ConvertTrialToBusinessJob` call is commented out because:
1. The job doesn't exist yet (R2-E04-T005)
2. Business model fields need verification (R2-E04-T006)
3. Assistant cloning logic needs implementation (R2-E04-T007)

This allows webhook infrastructure to ship first without circular dependencies.

### Idempotency Strategy

Idempotency is handled at the webhook framework level:
- `WebhookEvent` model has unique constraint on `provider + event_id`
- Duplicate Stripe webhooks (common during retries) are safely ignored
- No additional idempotency layer needed in processor

### Error Handling

Processors use graceful degradation:
- Missing metadata logs warning and returns early
- Malformed payload doesn't crash
- Unknown events log warning and complete processing
- Always marks webhook event as "completed" to prevent retry loops

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `app/jobs/webhook_processor_job.rb` - Updated Stripe routing
2. ✅ `spec/jobs/webhook_processor_job_spec.rb` - Added Stripe integration tests

## Files Created

1. ✅ `app/services/webhooks/stripe/checkout_session_processor.rb`
2. ✅ `app/services/webhooks/stripe/subscription_processor.rb`
3. ✅ `spec/services/webhooks/stripe/checkout_session_processor_spec.rb`
4. ✅ `spec/services/webhooks/stripe/subscription_processor_spec.rb`

## Integration Points

### Depends On
- ✅ `WebhooksController` with Stripe signature verification (Phase 0)
- ✅ `WebhookEvent` model with idempotency constraint (Phase 0)
- ✅ `WebhookProcessorJob` routing framework (Phase 0)

### Enables
- ⏭️ `ConvertTrialToBusinessJob` (R2-E04-T005) - Will enqueue from processor
- ⏭️ `Business` model creation (R2-E04-T006) - Will be created by job
- ⏭️ Assistant cloning (R2-E04-T007) - Will be called by job

## Exit Criteria Met

- ✅ Webhook processor routes `checkout.session.completed` events
- ✅ Stripe signature verification works (pre-existing)
- ✅ Idempotency enforced via unique constraint
- ✅ Missing metadata handled gracefully
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (16 new examples)
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Follows existing patterns (Vapi processor)

## Next Steps

1. **R2-E04-T005:** Implement `ConvertTrialToBusinessJob` to actually create businesses
2. **R2-E04-T006:** Verify Business model has all required fields
3. **R2-E04-T007:** Implement assistant cloning logic
4. **R2-E04-T005 integration:** Uncomment the job enqueue call in processor

## Notes

- VCR cassette at `spec/vcr_cassettes/upgrades/create_checkout_session.yml` shows 400 error (invalid price_id from old test). Not needed for this ticket.
- Processor currently logs what it would do rather than actually enqueuing job
- Subscription processor is pure stub - will be implemented in Phase 4
- Webhook framework already handles all Stripe signature verification in `WebhooksController`
