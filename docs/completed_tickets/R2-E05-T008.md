# R2-E05-T008: BusinessChannel Frontend Integration - COMPLETED ✅

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Points:** 3  
**Date:** February 2025  
**Epic:** E-005: Live Production

## Summary

Successfully implemented frontend integration for BusinessChannel, completing real-time updates for business dashboards. This ticket adds the missing Stimulus controller, dashboard UI, and proper routing to enable live updates when calls are processed and phone numbers are assigned.

## Problem Statement

R2-E05-T008's backend was already complete with BusinessChannel authorization and broadcast helpers. However, the frontend lacked:
1. Stimulus controller for subscribing to BusinessChannel
2. Dashboard view for business owners
3. Route for dashboard access
4. Frontend JavaScript wiring

## What Was Built

### 1. Created BusinessChannel Stimulus Controller ✅
**File:** `app/javascript/controllers/business_updates_controller.js`

ActionCable subscription controller that:
- Subscribes to BusinessChannel on page load
- Passes business ID for proper authorization
- Handles connection lifecycle (connect/disconnect)
- Logs updates for debugging

```javascript
export default class extends Controller {
  static values = { businessId: String }

  connect() {
    this.cable = ActionCable.createConsumer()
    this.subscription = this.cable.subscriptions.create(
      { channel: "BusinessChannel", id: this.businessIdValue },
      { received(data) { console.log("Received business update:", data) } }
    )
  }

  disconnect() {
    if (this.subscription) {
      this.cable.subscriptions.remove(this.subscription)
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Created BusinessesController ✅
**File:** `app/controllers/businesses_controller.rb`

Controller handling business dashboard with:
- Authentication required
- Ownership validation (users can only access their own businesses)
- Loads recent calls (last 20)
- Error handling for unauthorized access

```ruby
class BusinessesController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!
  before_action :set_business

  def dashboard
    @recent_calls = @business.calls.order(created_at: :desc).limit(20)
  end

  private

  def set_business
    @business = current_user.businesses.find(params[:id])
  rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
    flash[:error] = "Business not found"
    redirect_to root_path
  end
end
```

### 3. Added Dashboard Route ✅
**File:** `config/routes.rb`

Added route for business dashboard access:
```ruby
resources :businesses, only: [] do
  member do
    get :dashboard
  end
end
```

Also updated root route to redirect business owners to their dashboard:
```ruby
authenticated :user do
  root to: redirect { |params, request|
    user = request.env["warden"].user
    business = user.businesses.first
    business ? dashboard_business_path(business) : new_trial_path
  }, as: :authenticated_root
end
```

### 4. Created Dashboard View ✅
**File:** `app/views/businesses/dashboard.html.erb`

Dashboard UI with:
- Business name as header
- Phone number card (updates in real-time)
- Stats cards (calls used/remaining)
- Recent calls list (prepends new calls in real-time)
- Proper DOM IDs for Turbo Stream targets
- Stimulus controller data attributes for subscription

Uses `Primitives::CardComponent` for consistent styling across the app.

### 5. Created Number Partial ✅
**File:** `app/views/businesses/_number.html.erb`

Displays business phone number with:
- Formatted display: `(XXX) XXX-XXXX`
- Loading state: "Being assigned..." when number not yet provisioned
- Card layout with Primitives::CardComponent
- Updates in real-time via Turbo Stream when AssignTwilioNumberJob completes

### 6. Enhanced Stats Partial ✅
**File:** `app/views/businesses/_stats.html.erb`

Enhanced the existing stats partial to:
- Use Primitives::CardComponent for consistency
- Show calls used vs total in a grid layout
- Display calls remaining
- Update in real-time when new calls are processed

### 7. Updated Onboarding Flow ✅
**File:** `app/controllers/onboarding_controller.rb`

Changed redirect after successful conversion from `root_path` to `dashboard_business_path(business)` so users land on their dashboard immediately after Stripe checkout completes.

### 8. Registered Stimulus Controller ✅
**File:** `app/javascript/controllers/index.js`

Added business-updates controller registration so Stimulus can find and initialize it.

## Technical Details

### Authorization
- BusinessChannel validates ownership: `business.owners.include?(current_user)`
- BusinessesController restricts access to owned businesses: `current_user.businesses.find(params[:id])`
- Non-owners get redirected with error message

### Real-Time Updates
Broadcasts are sent from:
1. **AssignTwilioNumberJob** → `BusinessChannel.broadcast_number_assigned(business)`
2. **CallProcessor** → `broadcast_to_business(call, business)` when call ends

Both update:
- Phone number section (`id="business_number"`)
- Stats section (`id="business_stats"`)
- Calls list (`id="business_calls"`) - prepends new call

### Turbo Stream Targets
Dashboard uses specific DOM IDs for Turbo Stream updates:
- `business_number` - phone number display
- `business_stats` - KPI cards
- `business_calls` - recent calls list

### Stream Naming
BusinessChannel uses `stream_for business`, creating stream: `business:#{business.id}`

Broadcasts sent to: `"business:#{business.id}"`

### Styling Consistency
- Uses `Primitives::CardComponent` (same as admin panels)
- Follows existing color scheme (`text-muted-foreground`, etc.)
- Responsive with `container mx-auto` wrapper
- Grid layout for stats cards

## Integration Points

### With R2-E05-T005 (AssignTwilioNumberJob)
- BusinessChannel broadcast triggers phone number update on dashboard
- Users see number appear in real-time without refresh

### With R2-E05-T007 (Paid Call Processing)
- CallProcessor broadcasts new calls to dashboard
- Calls appear instantly as prepended cards
- Stats update automatically

### With R2-E04-T012 (Business Conversion)
- Onboarding flow redirects to dashboard
- New business owners see their dashboard immediately

## Next Steps

R2-E05-T009 (Dashboard UI: KPI tiles, full calls list) will build on this foundation to add:
