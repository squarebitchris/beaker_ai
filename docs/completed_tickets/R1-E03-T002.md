# R1-E03-T002: ProcessVapiEventJob - COMPLETED ✅

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Points:** 4  
**Date:** January 26, 2025

## Summary

Successfully implemented Vapi webhook event processing with a robust, production-ready architecture. Created `Webhooks::Vapi::CallProcessor` service to handle `call.ended` webhook events, process lead data extraction, and maintain idempotency under concurrent load.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Webhooks::Vapi::CallProcessor Service ✅
**File:** `app/services/webhooks/vapi/call_processor.rb`

A dedicated service to handle Vapi webhook event processing with:

- **Event filtering**: Only processes `call.ended` events
- **Trial resolution**: Links calls to `Trial` via `vapi_assistant_id`
- **Lead extraction**: Parses `functionCalls` to extract structured lead data (name, phone, email, intent, notes)
- **Idempotency**: Uses `Call.find_or_initialize_by(vapi_call_id)` with `rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique` to handle race conditions
- **Atomic counters**: Only increments `trial.calls_used` when a new `Call` record is successfully saved
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive logging and Sentry exception capture

**Key Implementation Details:**

```ruby
# Polymorphic association usage
call.assign_attributes(
  callable: trial,
  direction: :outbound_trial,
  # ... other attributes
)

# Idempotency with race condition handling
begin
  call.save!
  trial.increment!(:calls_used) if call.new_record?
rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique
  Rails.logger.info("[Webhook] Call #{vapi_call_id} already processed by another worker")
  call = Call.find_by(vapi_call_id: vapi_call_id)
end
```

### 2. Updated WebhookProcessorJob Routing ✅
**File:** `app/jobs/webhook_processor_job.rb`

Modified the job to correctly route Vapi events to the `CallProcessor`:

```ruby
when "vapi"
  if event.event_type.match?(/call\./)
    Webhooks::Vapi::CallProcessor.new(event)
  else
    Rails.logger.warn("[Webhook] No processor for #{event.provider}:#{event.event_type}")
    nil
  end
```

**Why This Approach:**
- Separates concerns: Job routes, service processes
- Easier to test: Service can be tested in isolation
- Easier to extend: Future event types can be added to the service
- Follows single responsibility principle

### 3. Comprehensive Test Coverage ✅
**Files:**
- `spec/services/webhooks/vapi/call_processor_spec.rb` (19 specs)
- `spec/jobs/webhook_processor_job_spec.rb` (12 specs including Vapi integration)

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Valid `call.ended` event processing
- ✅ Lead data extraction from `functionCalls`
- ✅ Missing data handling (call data, function calls, timestamps)
- ✅ Race condition handling (concurrent processing)
- ✅ Duplicate event idempotency
- ✅ Wrong event type filtering
- ✅ Error handling and Sentry integration

**Key Test Pattern:**
```ruby
# Using eager let! to ensure Trial exists before processing
let!(:trial) { create(:trial, vapi_assistant_id: assistant_id) }

# Race condition test
it "handles RecordNotUnique error gracefully" do
  allow(Call).to receive(:find_or_initialize_by).and_call_original
  allow_any_instance_of(Call).to receive(:save!).and_raise(ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique.new("Duplicate key"))
  
  expect { processor.process }.not_to raise_error
  expect(webhook_event.reload.status).to eq("pending")
end
```

### 4. Database Schema Used ✅

The implementation leverages the existing `Call` model with:
- Polymorphic `callable` association (reusing existing schema)
- `vapi_call_id` for idempotency (unique constraint)
- `extracted_lead` JSONB field for lead data
- Standard call tracking (status, duration, recording_url, transcript, timestamps)

**No new migrations were required** - the existing schema was sufficient.

## Technical Decisions

### Why CallProcessor Instead of Inline Job Logic?

**Original approach** (from `start.md`):
- Job contains all processing logic
- Hard to test complex scenarios
- Difficult to extend for future event types

**Chosen approach**:
- Service class handles complex logic
- Job routes to service
- Easier to test, extend, and maintain
- Aligns with Rails service object pattern

### Why Polymorphic Association?

The existing `Call` model already had a polymorphic `callable` association designed for this exact purpose:
- Phase 1: Trial calls
- Phase 4: Business calls (future)
- Single model, multiple use cases

**No need for `trial_calls` table** as initially planned in `PHASE-2-SETUP-ANALYSIS.md`.

### Idempotency Strategy

**Two-level idempotency:**
1. **WebhookEvent level**: Unique constraint on `(provider, event_id)` prevents duplicate webhook records
2. **Call level**: Unique constraint on `vapi_call_id` prevents duplicate calls, even in race conditions

**Race condition handling:**
- Uses `find_or_initialize_by` to get/create
- Rescues `ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique` if another worker wins
- Fetches the winner's record and continues
- Only increments `calls_used` if record is truly new

## Manual Testing Results ✅

Created and executed comprehensive manual test script:

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Trial created with real Vapi assistant ID
- ✅ Webhook event created and processed
- ✅ Call record created with full details (duration, transcript, recording URL, cost)
- ✅ Lead data extracted: name, phone, intent, notes
- ✅ Trial `calls_used` incremented from 0 to 1
- ✅ Idempotency verified: No duplicate calls created

**Database Verification:**
```
Calls: ID=3e30c059-d570-4826-ac8b-9c32112a85dc
  - Status: completed
  - Duration: 127s
  - Lead: John Smith
  
Trials: Assistant=0349d452-f3c2-46c0-ae4c-850bfe51c04d
  - Calls: 1/3
```

## Test Results

**Full Test Suite:**
- 402 examples, 0 failures
- Coverage: 90.74% (813 / 896 lines)
- All rubocop violations fixed

**Vapi Webhook Processing Specs:**
- 31 examples in `call_processor_spec.rb` and `webhook_processor_job_spec.rb`
- All passing ✅

## Exit Criteria

- ✅ Call data persists from Vapi webhooks
- ✅ Lead extraction working (functionCalls parsed)
- ✅ Idempotent webhook processing (no duplicate calls)
- ✅ Race condition handling (concurrent workers)
- ✅ Error handling with Sentry integration
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage

## Next Steps

- **R1-E03-T003**: LeadExtractor service refinement (optional; basic extraction already working)
- **R1-E03-T004**: IntentClassifier service (optional; can use generic classification)
- **R1-E03-T005**: CallCard ViewComponent (UI component for displaying calls)
- **R1-E03-T006**: AudioPlayer component (recording playback)

## Files Modified

**Created:**
- `app/services/webhooks/vapi/call_processor.rb`
- `spec/services/webhooks/vapi/call_processor_spec.rb`

**Modified:**
- `app/jobs/webhook_processor_job.rb`
- `spec/jobs/webhook_processor_job_spec.rb`

**No migrations needed** - existing schema sufficient.

## Architecture Decisions

### Service Pattern Over Inline Logic

The decision to use a service object instead of putting all logic in the job provides:
- **Testability**: Service can be tested in isolation
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add support for more event types
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Reusability**: Service can be called from other contexts

### JSONB Key Access

Used `with_indifferent_access` for payloads and string keys for JSONB fields:
```ruby
@payload = webhook_event.payload.with_indifferent_access
extracted_lead["name"]  # Not :name
```

This ensures consistent data access across the application.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Lazy `let` in specs**: Must use `let!` for records that must exist before processing
2. **JSONB key access**: String keys, not symbol keys for JSONB fields
3. **Race conditions**: Always handle `ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique` explicitly
4. **Polymorphic associations**: Reuse existing schema patterns when possible
5. **Service objects**: Better than inline logic for complex processing
