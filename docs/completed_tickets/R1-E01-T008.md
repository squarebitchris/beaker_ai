# R1-E01-T008: Set up RSpec + FactoryBot + test infrastructure

**Epic:** E-001: Rails Foundation & Infrastructure  
**Points:** 3  
**Priority:** P0  
**Dependencies:** R1-E01-T001  
**Completed:** October 25, 2025

## Overview

This ticket completed the comprehensive test infrastructure setup for Beaker AI, building upon the existing RSpec and FactoryBot foundation to create a production-ready testing environment with modern productivity features, coverage reporting, and parallel execution capabilities.

## What Was Done

### 1. Enhanced RSpec Configuration ✅

**File:** `spec/spec_helper.rb`

Enabled all modern RSpec productivity features by uncommenting the configuration block:

- **Focus Mode**: `fit`, `fdescribe`, `fcontext` for debugging specific tests
- **Failure Persistence**: `--only-failures` and `--next-failure` flags for efficient debugging
- **Monkey Patching Disabled**: Cleaner, modern RSpec syntax
- **Performance Profiling**: Reports 10 slowest examples after each run
- **Random Execution**: Prevents test order dependencies

### 2. Test Coverage Reporting ✅

**Files:** `.simplecov`, `Gemfile`, `spec/rails_helper.rb`

Implemented comprehensive test coverage tracking:

- **SimpleCov Integration**: 93.82% line coverage achieved
- **Coverage Groups**: Organized by Models, Controllers, Services, Jobs
- **Minimum Threshold**: 80% overall coverage requirement
- **Filtered Directories**: Excludes spec/, config/, vendor/ from coverage
- **HTML Reports**: Generated in `coverage/index.html`

### 3. VCR Configuration Fixed ✅

**File:** `spec/support/vcr.rb`

Re-enabled and improved VCR for API testing:

- **Cassette Storage**: Proper storage in `spec/vcr_cassettes/`
- **Sensitive Data Filtering**: All API keys and tokens filtered
- **Re-record Intervals**: 90-day refresh cycle
- **Localhost Ignore**: Prevents interference with local development

### 4. Database Cleaner Strategy ✅

**File:** `spec/support/database_cleaner.rb`

Implemented robust database cleanup:

- **Transaction Strategy**: Fast cleanup for most tests
- **Truncation Strategy**: Thorough cleanup for feature tests
- **Suite Cleanup**: Full database reset before test runs
- **Per-test Cleanup**: Ensures clean state between tests

### 5. Parallel Test Execution ✅

**Files:** `.rspec_parallel`, `Gemfile`

Added parallel testing support:

- **8 Process Execution**: ~2 specs per process
- **Performance Improvement**: 7 seconds vs 9.38 seconds sequential
- **Configuration File**: Separate `.rspec_parallel` config
- **Coverage Support**: Maintains coverage reporting in parallel mode

### 6. Comprehensive Documentation ✅

**File:** `spec/support/README.md`

Created detailed documentation covering:

- **CircuitBreakerHelpers**: Testing circuit breaker behavior
- **JobHelpers**: Background job testing utilities
- **FactoryBot Patterns**: Factory usage and traits
- **Shoulda Matchers**: Rails-specific assertions
- **VCR Best Practices**: API testing patterns
- **Testing Examples**: Model, service, request, and job specs

### 7. Factory Validation ✅

**File:** `spec/factories_spec.rb`

Implemented comprehensive factory linting:

- **Factory Lint**: Validates all factories build successfully
- **Trait Testing**: Ensures all traits work correctly
- **Association Testing**: Verifies polymorphic relationships
- **State Testing**: Tests different factory states (active, expired, etc.)

### 8. Git Configuration ✅

**File:** `.gitignore`

Added test-related ignores:

- **Coverage Reports**: `/coverage/` directory
- **Test Persistence**: `/spec/examples.txt` for failure tracking
- **SimpleCov Results**: `.simplecov_results_*` files

## Technical Implementation Details

### Gems Added

```ruby
group :test do
  # Test coverage reporting
  gem "simplecov", require: false
  gem "simplecov-console", require: false
  
  # Database cleaning for tests
  gem "database_cleaner-active_record"
  
  # Parallel test execution
  gem "parallel_tests"
end
```

### Key Configuration Files

1. **`.simplecov`** - Coverage configuration with 80% minimum threshold
2. **`.rspec_parallel`** - Parallel execution configuration
3. **`spec/support/database_cleaner.rb`** - Database cleanup strategy
4. **`spec/support/README.md`** - Comprehensive testing documentation

### Test Commands Available

```bash
# Run all tests
bundle exec rspec

# Run tests in parallel (faster)
bundle exec parallel_rspec spec/

# Run only failed tests
bundle exec rspec --only-failures

# Run focused tests
bundle exec rspec --tag focus

# View coverage report
open coverage/index.html
```

## Results & Metrics

### Test Suite Performance
- **Total Tests**: 153 examples
- **Test Results**: 0 failures, 100% pass rate
- **Coverage**: 93.82% line coverage (410/437 lines)
- **Execution Time**: 9.46 seconds sequential, 7 seconds parallel
- **Performance Improvement**: 26% faster with parallel execution

### Code Quality
- **RuboCop**: 0 offenses detected
- **Factory Linting**: All factories validated successfully
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with examples

### Test Infrastructure Features
- ✅ Focus mode for debugging
- ✅ Failure persistence for efficient re-runs
- ✅ Performance profiling
- ✅ Random test execution
- ✅ Coverage reporting with HTML output
- ✅ VCR for API testing
- ✅ Database cleanup strategies
- ✅ Parallel execution support
- ✅ Factory validation
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## Exit Criteria Met

- [x] All RSpec productivity features enabled in spec_helper.rb
- [x] SimpleCov generating coverage reports (93.82% > 80% target)
- [x] VCR properly configured and working for API tests
- [x] Factory linting passes with comprehensive validation
- [x] Documentation created for all test helpers
- [x] Test suite runs successfully with: `bundle exec rspec`
- [x] Parallel tests work with: `bundle exec parallel_rspec spec/`

## Impact

This ticket establishes a robust, production-ready testing infrastructure that will:

1. **Improve Developer Productivity**: Focus mode, failure persistence, and profiling
2. **Ensure Code Quality**: 93.82% test coverage with comprehensive validation
3. **Enable Fast Feedback**: Parallel execution reduces test time by 26%
4. **Support API Testing**: VCR configuration for external service testing
5. **Maintain Clean State**: Database cleaner ensures reliable test isolation
6. **Provide Documentation**: Comprehensive guide for testing best practices

The testing infrastructure is now ready to support the development of Phase 1 features with confidence in code quality and reliability.

## Next Steps

With R1-E01-T008 complete, the project can proceed to:
- **R1-E01-T009**: Configure Rack::Attack for rate limiting
- **R1-E01-T010**: Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline
- **R1-E01-T011**: Deploy to staging
- **R1-E01-T012**: Create design system foundation

The solid testing foundation established here will ensure all future features are properly tested and maintainable.
