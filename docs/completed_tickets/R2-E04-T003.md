# R2-E04-T003: Checkout Session Endpoint - COMPLETED ✅

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Points:** 3  
**Date:** January 26, 2025  
**Epic:** E-004: Monetization

## Summary

Successfully transformed the placeholder upgrade flow into a fully functional Stripe checkout system with two-plan selection (Starter/Pro), secure session creation, idempotency, and onboarding pages. Users can now select a plan and be redirected to Stripe Checkout for payment, with comprehensive error handling and authorization.

## Changes Made

### 1. UpgradesController - Full Stripe Integration ✅

**File:** `app/controllers/upgrades_controller.rb`

Replaced placeholder with complete Stripe checkout logic:

- **Authorization:** Validates trial ownership and eligibility
- **Plan Selection:** Loads active Stripe plans for display
- **Checkout Creation:** Creates Stripe checkout session with metadata
- **Idempotency:** Uses `checkout:user_id:trial_id` key to prevent duplicates
- **Error Handling:** Circuit breaker protection and Sentry logging

```ruby
def create
  plan_name = params.require(:plan)
  stripe_plan = StripePlan.for_plan(plan_name)
  
  # Create checkout session with idempotency
  idempotency_key = "checkout:#{current_user.id}:#{@trial.id}"
  
  checkout_session = StripeClient.new.create_checkout_session(
    price_id: stripe_plan.stripe_price_id,
    customer_email: current_user.email,
    metadata: {
      trial_id: @trial.id,
      user_id: current_user.id,
      plan: plan_name,
      business_name: @trial.business_name
    },
    idempotency_key: idempotency_key
  )
  
  redirect_to checkout_session.url, allow_other_host: true
rescue Stripe::StripeError => e
  # Error handling...
end
```

### 2. Plan Selection UI ✅

**File:** `app/views/upgrades/new.html.erb`

Beautiful pricing cards for Starter ($199) and Pro ($499) plans:

- Side-by-side plan comparison with checkmarks
- "Most Popular" badge on Pro plan
- Mobile-responsive grid layout
- Form submissions with plan selection

**Features:**
- Shows calls included (100 vs 300)
- Lists all benefits (dedicated number, lead capture, dashboard)
- Priority support for Pro plan
- Prominent CTA buttons

### 3. OnboardingController ✅

**File:** `app/controllers/onboarding_controller.rb`

Post-checkout provisioning flow:

- **show:** Onboarding page with polling UI
- **status:** JSON endpoint for provisioning status
- **success:** Thank you page (no auth required)
- **cancel:** Cancel confirmation page

```ruby
before_action :authenticate_user!, except: [:cancel, :success, :status]

def status
  # Phase 3: Returns provisioning status
  render json: { status: "pending", message: "Setting up your account..." }
end
```

### 4. Onboarding Views ✅

**Files Created:**
- `app/views/onboarding/show.html.erb` - Polling page with animated spinner
- `app/views/onboarding/success.html.erb` - Thank you page
- `app/views/onboarding/cancel.html.erb` - Cancel confirmation

**Features:**
- Auto-polling JavaScript for status updates
- 30-second timeout with graceful error handling
- Mobile-optimized layouts

### 5. Routes Configuration ✅

**File:** `config/routes.rb`

Added complete routing structure:

```ruby
# Stripe checkout flow
resources :upgrades, only: [:create], param: :trial_id
get "/upgrade/:trial_id", to: "upgrades#new", as: :new_upgrade

# Onboarding flow
get "/onboarding", to: "onboarding#show", as: :onboarding
get "/onboarding/status", to: "onboarding#status", as: :onboarding_status
get "/success", to: "onboarding#success", as: :checkout_success
get "/cancel", to: "onboarding#cancel", as: :checkout_cancel
```

### 6. Environment Configuration ✅

**File:** `env.example`

Updated Stripe URLs to include session_id placeholder:

```bash
STRIPE_SUCCESS_URL=http://localhost:3000/onboarding?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}
STRIPE_CANCEL_URL=http://localhost:3000/cancel
```

### 7. Comprehensive Test Suite ✅

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `spec/requests/upgrades_spec.rb` - 10 request tests
- `spec/requests/onboarding_spec.rb` - 5 onboarding tests
- `spec/system/upgrade_cta_spec.rb` - Updated for new UI
- `spec/system/upgrade_flow_spec.rb` - End-to-end upgrade tests
- `spec/support/passwordless_helpers.rb` - Auth helper for tests

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Authentication and authorization
- ✅ Plan selection and pricing display
- ✅ Checkout session creation and redirect
- ✅ Error handling and circuit breaker
- ✅ Trial validation (expired, not ready, converted)
- ✅ Idempotency tracking
- ✅ Onboarding flow

### 8. Passwordless Auth Helper ✅

**File:** `spec/support/passwordless_helpers.rb`

Created helper to enable `sign_in` for request specs with passwordless authentication:

```ruby
config.before(:each, type: :request) do
  def sign_in(user)
    login_as(user, scope: :user)
  end
end
```

## Authorization & Security

### Trial Ownership Validation
- Only trial owner can initiate checkout
- Prevents unauthorized upgrades

### Trial Eligibility Checks
- Trial must be active and ready
- Cannot upgrade expired trials
- Cannot upgrade already-converted trials
- Must wait for assistant to be ready

### Idempotency
- Prevents duplicate checkout sessions
- Uses `checkout:user_id:trial_id` key
- Stripe-level idempotency protection

## Error Handling

### Stripe Errors
- Captures all Stripe exceptions
- Logs to Sentry with context
- Shows user-friendly error messages

### Circuit Breaker Protection
- Prevents cascade failures
- User-friendly "temporarily unavailable" message
- Auto-recovery after timeout

## User Flow

1. User clicks "Upgrade" from trial page
2. Sees plan selection with pricing
3. Clicks "Choose Starter" or "Choose Pro"
4. Redirected to Stripe Checkout
5. Completes payment
6. Redirected to `/onboarding?session_id=cs_...`
7. Onboarding page polls for provisioning status (Phase 3)
8. Eventually redirected to business dashboard

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ **Plan Selection:** Two plans displayed with pricing  
✅ **Checkout Creation:** Session created with correct metadata  
✅ **Idempotency:** Duplicate sessions prevented  
✅ **Stripe Redirect:** Proper URL and test mode support  
✅ **Authorization:** Only trial owner can upgrade  
✅ **Error Handling:** Stripe and circuit breaker errors handled  
✅ **Onboarding:** Polling page created  
✅ **Tests:** 15 examples, all passing  

## Test Results

```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/requests/upgrades_spec.rb spec/requests/onboarding_spec.rb
# 15 examples, 0 failures
```

## Manual Testing Checklist

To test manually:

1. Run `rails db:seed` to ensure StripePlan records exist
2. Set Stripe test keys in `.env`
3. Visit trial page, click "Upgrade"
4. Verify plan selection UI shows both plans ($199 vs $499)
5. Click "Choose Starter" → redirects to Stripe Checkout
6. Use test card `4242 4242 4242 4242` to complete checkout
7. Verify redirect to `/onboarding?session_id=cs_...`
8. Check logs for any errors
